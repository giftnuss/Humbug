Maybe this becomes another small perl web framework.
It is inspired by various other small web frameworks found
on CPAN.

   * Leyland - http://github.com/ido50/Leyland
   * Lamework - http://github.com/vti/lamework
   * Pickles - http://github.com/ikebe/Pickles
   * Sloth - https://metacpan.org/module/Sloth
   * Babble - https://metacpan.org/release/Babble
   * WebNano - https://github.com/zby/WebNano

I take what I like and combine it new. The time will tell
if Lair becomes a snugly place for web development.

Some inspiration for the design of the view component comes from
http://perl.jonallen.info - Web Mashups with Catalyst.
