Maybe this becomes another small perl web framework.
It is inspired by various other small web frameworks found
on CPAN.

   * Leyland - http://github.com/ido50/Leyland
   * Lamework - http://github.com/vti/lamework
   * Pickles - http://github.com/ikebe/Pickles

I take what I like and combine it new. The time will tell
if Lair becomes a snugly place for web development.
